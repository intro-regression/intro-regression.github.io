The center of the distribution is around the median of 1779.5 grams and the interquartile range (IQR) is 2087 grams. The distribution is bimodal, which may be due to the multiple taxa represented in the data. There is one lemur with a high outlying weight of 6969 grams.

Finally, a vast majority of the lemurs were born as the only lemur in their litter as seen in @fig-mlr-pred-var-4.\n\n::: {.yourturn latex=\"\"}\nUse the visualizations in @fig-mlr-pred-var and summary statistics in @tbl-mlr-pred-var to describe the distribution of `age`.[^07-mlr-1]\n:::\n\n[^07-mlr-1]: The distribution of `age` is unimodal and skewed right, so the center is best described by the median 7.1 months and spread by the IQR of 12.8 months. There does not appear to be any outliers for age in the data.\n\nNow, we conduct bivariate exploratory data analysis, shown in @fig-mlr-bivariate, to explore the relationship between the response and each of the predictor variables.\n\n\n::: {#fig-mlr-bivariate .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![`weight` vs. `age`](07-mlr_files/figure-html/fig-mlr-bivariate-1.png){#fig-mlr-bivariate-1 width=100%}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![`weight` vs. `taxon`](07-mlr_files/figure-html/fig-mlr-bivariate-2.png){#fig-mlr-bivariate-2 width=100%}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![`weight` vs. `sex`](07-mlr_files/figure-html/fig-mlr-bivariate-3.png){#fig-mlr-bivariate-3 width=100%}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![`weight` vs. `litter_size`](07-mlr_files/figure-html/fig-mlr-bivariate-4.png){#fig-mlr-bivariate-4 width=100%}\n:::\n\nBivariate exploratory data analysis\n:::\n\n\nFrom @fig-mlr-bivariate-1, we see a strong, positive relationship between `age` and `weight`. The relationship looks linear; however, the relationship flattens as age increases. This aligns with what we might expect; lemurs experience fairly rapid growth early on, and then their growth rate slows over time. In @sec-ch-transformations, we will introduce transformations that can be applied to the predictor and response variables to account for such trends in the model. For now, we will model the relationship as a constant rate of change between `age` and `weight`.\n\nIn @fig-mlr-bivariate-2, lemurs from the PCOQ taxon have a lower median weight than lemurs from ERUF or VRUB: however, there is a lot of overlap in the distribution of weights of ERUF and PCOQ lemurs. Lemurs in the VRUB taxon have the highest median weight; however, the middle 50% of the distribution overlaps greatly with the distribution for PCOQ lemurs. There is more variability in the weights of PCOQ lemurs compared to ERUF and VRUB, and we see the lemur with the outlier weight is in the PCOQ taxon.\n\nBased on the medians and large overlap in the boxplots in @fig-mlr-bivariate-3, there does not appear to be much difference in the weights of male and female lemurs. From this plot, we see the lemur with the high outlying weight is a female.\n\n@fig-mlr-bivariate-4 shows the relationship between `litter_size` and `weight`. Random noise was added to reduce overlap in the points on the graph. This makes it easier to see the relationship between the two variables. Based on this scatterplot, the relationship between `litter_size` and `weight` appears to be positive and relatively weak.\n\nNow that we have a better understanding of the variables in this analysis, we will use a multiple linear regression model to understand how taxon, litter size, age, and sex explains variability in the weight of lemurs. Before looking at the model specific to this data, we will discuss the details of the multiple linear regression model, in general, and to determine if a multiple linear regression model is appropriate for the data.\n\n<!--# add something about the outlier and you'll explore as an exercise if this is an influential point-->\n\n## Fitting the regression line {#sec-mlr-fit-line}\n\nIn @sec-ch-slr, we introduced simple linear regression to quantify the relationship between a response and a single predictor variable. Using multiple linear regression, we can expand on the regression model to quantify the relationship between a response variable and multiple predictors.\n\n### Statistical model for multiple linear regression\n\nRecall from @sec-fit-regression that the general form of a model for a response variable $Y$ is\n\n$$\nY = \\text{Model} + \\text{Error}\n$$ {#eq-general-model-recap}\n\nIn the case of simple linear regression, $\\text{Model} = f(X)$ where $X$ is the predictor variable used to explain the variability in $Y$. Now we will expand @eq-general-model-recap to the case in which multiple predictor variables, denoted $\\mathbf{X} = X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_p$ are used in combination to explain variability in the response variable $Y$. The values of the response variable $Y$ are generated based on the following equation\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nY &= \\text{Model} + \\text{Error} \\\\[5pt]\n& = f(\\mathbf{X}) + \\epsilon \\\\[5pt]\n& = f(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_p) + \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-general-model-mlr}\n\nwhere $p$ represents the number of predictor variables and $\\epsilon$ is the error term quantifying the amount in which the actual value of $Y$ differs from what is expected from the model $f(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_p)$.\n\n@eq-general-model-mlr is the general form of the model. As with simple linear regression, we know the form of $f(X_1,  X_2, \\ldots, X_p)$ when we assume there is a linear relationship between the response and predictor variables. @eq-general-model-mlr can be more specifically written as a **multiple linear regression model** (MLR) of the form\n\n$$\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + \\dots + \\beta_pX_p + \\epsilon, \\hspace{8mm} \\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_{\\epsilon})\n$$ {#eq-mlr-stat-model-1}\n\nwhere $\\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_{\\epsilon})$ indicates the error terms are normally distributed with a mean of 0 and variance $\\sigma^2_{\\epsilon}$. @eq-mlr-stat-model-1 is the population-level statistical model for multiple linear regression.\n\nRecall from @sec-slr-specify, the function $f(X) = \\mu_{Y|X}$ is the expected value (mean) of $Y$ given a value of the predictor $X$. Extending this to multiple linear regression, $f(\\mathbf{X}) = f(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_p)$ outputs the expected value of $Y$ for a combination of the predictors. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\mu_{Y|\\mathbf{X}} = \\mu_{Y|X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_p} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + \\dots + \\beta_pX_p\n$$ {#eq-mlr-exp-y}\n\nThus, when we fit a multiple linear regression model, the output from the fitted model will be the predicted expected value of the response variable for a given combination of values of the predictor variables.\n\n### Evaluating whether MLR is appropriate\n\n<!--# could this section be a callout box?-->\n\nBefore we move forward with fitting the regression model, we should first ask whether the multiple linear regression model is appropriate or useful for the data. We can ask the same questions we did for simple linear regression; however, now we are considering the relationship between $Y$ and multiple predictor variables rather than a single predictor.\n\n-   Will a linear regression model be practically useful? Does quantifying and interpreting the relationship between the variables make sense in this scenario?\n-   Do the observations in the data represent the population of interest, or are there biases that should be addressed when drawing conclusions from the analysis? <!--# Differentiate this from the first two bullet points. Make clear if the first two points are violated, we definitely shouldn't do SLR. If this one is violated, we can still do SLR but need to be mindful about the scope of conclusions.-->\n-   Would a linear regression model reasonably summarize the relationship between the response and predictor variables?\n\nThe last question can be more challenging to answer for multiple linear regression than it was in simple linear regression, because it is difficult to visualize the relationship between three or more variables in the exploratory data analysis. As we saw in @sec-mlr-eda, we can visualize the relationship between the response and each individual predictor. This can give us some indication of linearity and if there are non-linear trends that need to be taken into account (more on this in @sec-ch-transformations). We will primarily rely on the assessment of the model conditions ([@sec-mlr-conditions-diagnositics]) to ultimately determine whether a linear model adequately captures the relationship between the response and predictor variables. <!--# maybe add a your turn or some discussion about whether it's appropriate to do MLR for lemurs data-->\n\n## Estimating the coefficients {#sec-mlr-estimate-coef}\n\nThe predicted value $Y$ for the $i^{th}$ observation output from the estimated multiple linear regression is shown in @eq-mlr-estimated-model is\n\n$$\n\\hat{y}_i = \\hat{\\mu}_{y_i|x_{i1},x_{i2}, \\ldots, x_{ip}} = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1x_{i1} + \\hat{\\beta}_2x_{i2} + \\dots + \\hat{\\beta}_px_{ip}\n$$ {#eq-mlr-estimated-model}\n\nThe error term for the $i^{th}$ observation, $\\epsilon_i$, is estimated by calculating the residuals as before, $e_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_i$, the difference between what is observed in the data and what is expected from @eq-mlr-estimated-model. As with simple linear regression in @sec-slr-estimation, the coefficients are estimated using least-squares, finding $\\hat{\\beta}_0, \\hat{\\beta}_1, \\ldots, \\hat{\\beta}_p$ that minimize the sum of square residuals shown in @eq-mlr-min-sse\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n}e_i^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - [\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_{i1} + \\dots+ \\beta_px_{ip}])^2\n$$ {#eq-mlr-min-sse}\n\n### (Optional) Matrix notation for multiple linear regression\n\n<!--# is there a more obvious way to mark optional text?-->\n\n<!--# should all of this just go in the appendix?-->\n\nThe calculus required to find the values that minimize @eq-mlr-min-sse can become quite cumbersome, <!--# word here to indicate it's a lot of work not necessarily hard-->particularly if there are a lot of predictor variables. We can instead think of @eq-mlr-stat-model-1 and @eq-mlr-estimated-model in terms of matrices and utilize linear algebra and matrix calculus <!--# are these the correct terms or can i say matrix algebra and calculus?--> to compute the estimated coefficients. Suppose there are $n$ observations and $p$ predictors, then\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{Y} = \\begin{bmatrix}y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\y_n\\end{bmatrix} \\hspace{10mm}\n\\mathbf{X} = \\begin{bmatrix}1 & x_{11} & x_{12} & \\dots & x_{1p} \\\\1& x_{21} & x_{22} & \\dots & x_{2p} \\\\\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\1& x_{n1} & x_{n2} & \\dots & x_{np} \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{Y}$ is an $n \\times 1$ vector of the values of the response, and $\\mathbf{X}$ is an $n \\times (p + 1)$ matrix called the **design matrix**. The first column of $\\mathbf{X}$ is a vector of 1's that correspond to the intercept $\\beta_0$. The remaining columns are the observed values for each predictor variable. For example, the row $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & x_{11}  & x_{12} &  \\dots & x_{1p} \\end{bmatrix}$ contains the observed values for the first observation, and\n\nthe column $\\begin{bmatrix} x_{11}  & x_{21} &  \\dots & x_{n1} \\end{bmatrix}^\\mathsf{T}$ is the column of observed values for predictor $X_1$.\n\nAdditionally, let\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\beta}= \\begin{bmatrix}\\beta_0 \\\\ \\beta_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_p \\end{bmatrix} \\hspace{5mm}\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}= \\begin{bmatrix}\\epsilon_1 \\\\ \\epsilon_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\epsilon_n \\end{bmatrix} \n$$\n\nsuch that $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is a $(p + 1) \\times 1$ vector of the model coefficients and $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ is an $n \\times 1$ vector of the error terms. @eq-mlr-stat-model-1 written in matrix notation is\n\n$$\n\\underbrace{\\begin{bmatrix}y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\y_n\\end{bmatrix}}_{\\mathbf{Y}} = \n \\underbrace{\\begin{bmatrix}1 & x_{11} & x_{12} & \\dots & x_{1p} \\\\1& x_{21} & x_{22} & \\dots & x_{2p} \\\\\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\1& x_{n1} & x_{n2} & \\dots & x_{np} \\end{bmatrix}}_{\\mathbf{X}} \\hspace{2mm}\n\\underbrace{\\begin{bmatrix}\\beta_0 \\\\ \\beta_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_p \\end{bmatrix}}_{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}  + \n\\underbrace{\\begin{bmatrix}\\epsilon_1 \\\\ \\epsilon_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\epsilon_n \\end{bmatrix}}_{\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{Y} = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\n$$ {#eq-mlr-stat-model-matrix}\n\nSimilarly, @eq-mlr-estimated-model in matrix notation is\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\beta}}\n$$\n\nApplying the rules of linear algebra and matrix calculus, we find that the estimated coefficients $\\hat{\\beta}_0, \\hat{\\beta}_1, \\ldots, \\hat{\\beta}_p$ can be found using @eq-mlr-est-beta-matrix\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^\\mathsf{T}\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^\\mathsf{T} \\mathbf{Y}\n$$ {#eq-mlr-est-beta-matrix}\n\nDetails for using the matrix form of the model to find $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ in @eq-mlr-est-beta-matrix are in @sec-mlr-estimation-matrix.\n\n::: {.math_rules latex=\"\"}\n**Matrix form of simple linear regression**\n\nThe design matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ and the vector of coefficients $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ are indexed by the number of predictors $p$. The number of predictors can be any value between 1 and $n$, the number of observations[^07-mlr-2]. Therefore, the linear regression computations in matrix form apply to simple linear regression as well.\n\n<br>\\\nOne way to practice using the matrix representation of the model is to compare the results from simple linear regression in @sec-slr-estimation to the results using matrix notation.\n:::\n\n[^07-mlr-2]: It is possible to fit models such that $p > n$.

Given a quantitative predictor $x_j$, its model coefficient $\\beta_j$ is the slope describing the relationship between $x_j$ and the response variable, *after accounting for the other predictors in the model*. For example, the coefficient for `age` in @tbl-lemurs-model is 136.903. Let's compare this to the coefficient from a simple linear regression model using age shown in @tbl-lemurs-age-model-slr.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-lemurs-age-model-slr .cell tbl-cap='Simple linear regression model of `weight` versus `age`'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|term        | estimate| std.error| statistic| p.value|\n|:-----------|--------:|---------:|---------:|-------:|\n|(Intercept) |      555|     67.31|      8.25|       0|\n|age         |      142|      5.88|     24.12|       0|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the model in @tbl-lemurs-age-model-slr that only uses `age` to predict `weight`, the weight is expected to increase by 141.892 grams, on average for each month increase in age. If we also take into account sex, taxon, and litter size in addition to age, then the weight is expected to increase by 136.903 grams, on average, as age increases by one month. This means some of the change in weight as age increases in @tbl-lemurs-age-model-slr can be explained by the other predictors in @tbl-lemurs-model.\n\n\\\nWe write the interpretation of the coefficients in a multiple linear regression models in a way that indicates there are other variables being taken into account in the model. There are two commonly used ways to word this. The first is by interpreting the coefficient $\\beta_j$ as the expected change in the response variable when $x_j$ increases by one unit, *adjusting for all other predictors in the model*. This interpretation means that once we have taken into account the relationship between all the other predictors and the response variable, then we have isolated the effect of the predictor $x_j$ and thus can explain the relationship between the response variable and the predictor $x_j$. The second way is to specify that *all other predictors are held constant*. This means that if have two observations with the same values for all other predictors, then we see how the value of the response is expected to change between these two observations as $x_j$ changes. <!--# Add something noting that these are th same thing-->\n\nLet's apply this to interpret `age` in the model in @tbl-lemurs-model. The following are two acceptable forms of the interpretation:\n\n> *For each additional month in a young lemur's age, their weight is expected to be greater by 136.903 grams, on average, adjusting for taxon, sex, and litter size.*\n>\n> *For each additional month in a young lemur's age, their weight is expected to be greater by 136.903 grams, on average, holding taxon, sex, and litter size constant.*\n\nThe phrase \"holding all else constant\" stems from the fact that multiple linear regression is conducted assuming the predictors are independent. Some argue, however, that it is not feasible for the predictors to be completely independent in practice, so the phrasing \"adjusting for all other predictors\" may better represent the model in practice. We will use both forms of the interpretation throughout the book. We talk more about more the relationship between the predictors in @sec-ch-mlr-inf.\n\n<!--# this all seems very clunky.

To do so, **indicator variable**s are created for each level of the categorical predictor. We then use these indicator variables in the regression model.\n\nSuppose we have a categorical variable that has $k$ levels. We define $k$ indicator variables, one for each level, such that the indicator takes the value $1$ if the observation belongs to the particular level and $0$ if the observation does not belong to the particular level. Let's take a look at the variable `taxon` in the lemurs data.\n\n<!--# Key term: An indicator variable represents a specific level of a categorical variable. It takes the value 1 if an observation is in that level and 0 otherwise. Indicator variables are used for categorical predictors in a model.-->\n\nThe variable `taxon` has three levels, ERUF, PCOQ, and VRUB, so we create three indicator variables. We will call these indicators `taxonERUF`, `taxonPCOQ`, and `taxonVRUB`. @tbl-indicators, shows the number of observation at each level of the original variable `taxon` and the number of observations that take values 1 or 0 for each indicator variable.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-indicators .cell tbl-cap='Indicator variables for taxon'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|taxon | taxonERUF| taxonPCOQ| taxonVRUB|   n|\n|:-----|---------:|---------:|---------:|---:|\n|ERUF  |         1|         0|         0|  48|\n|PCOQ  |         0|         1|         0|  93|\n|VRUB  |         0|         0|         1| 111|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow we are ready to use the indicator variables in the model. In @tbl-lemurs-model, we see there are only two indicator variables (not three) for `taxon` in the model. When there are $k$ levels of a categorical predictor, there are $k-1$ indicator variables for the categorical predictor included in the model. The level that does not have an indicator variable in the model is called the **baseline level** (this is also known as the *reference level*). Thus, the interpretation of the coefficients for indicator variables describe how much the expected response for a given level is expected to differ, on average, compared to the expected response at the baseline level, after adjusting for the other predictors in the model. <!--# or holding all other predictors constant.-->\n\n```{=html}\n<!--# ::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"} \n<!--# ## Why not put all $k$ indicators in the model?\n\n\\[Add content\\]\n\n<!--# Make note here about how this doesn't work mathematically.-->\n```\n\n<!--# Maybe conceptually, we can say with an intercept in the model, it doesn't make sense for all the indicators to be equal to 0.-->\n\nLet's take a look at the indicator variables for `taxon` in @tbl-lemurs-model. The baseline level is \"ERUF\", the taxon that is not represented by an indicator variable in the model. Therefore, the interpretations of the coefficients for `taxonPCOQ` and `taxonVRUB` will be how the weights for young lemurs in those taxa are expected to differ, on average, to the weight for lemurs in the ERUF taxon, after adjusting for age, sex, and litter size.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n> *The coefficient for the PCOQ taxon is* $\\hat{\\beta}_{PCOQ} =$ *471.715.

R (and other statistical software) will create indicator variables behind the scenes and selects the baseline level as the following:\n\n-   If the categorical predictor is nominal (it has no inherent order like `taxon`), then R chooses the first level alphabetically to be the baseline. R made ERUF the baseline level for `taxon`, because it is first alphabetically in the list of ERUF, PCOQ, and VRUB.\n\n-   If the categorical predictor is ordinal (there is some order imposed), then R chooses the lowest level to be the baseline.\n\nAs the data scientists, we can determine which level we would like to be the baseline level if neither of these approaches align well with the data. To do so, use functions to impose an ordering with the desired baseline as the first level.\n:::\n\nIndicator variables in the model describe how much the intercept of the model shifts based on the levels of the categorical variable.

The average weight for male lemurs is about 88.838 grams less than the average weight for female lemurs, holding taxon, age, and litter size constant. The intercept for female lemurs is 43.844 .The intercept for male lemurs is -44.994 (43.844 + -88.838 ).\n\n### Interpreting the intercept {#sec-intercept}\n\nAs with simple linear regression, the intercept is the expected value of the response when all predictors in the model equal 0. Let's take a look at what this means for our model in @tbl-lemurs-model. The intercept is at the point such that\n\n<!--# make sure these match the tidytuesday definitions-->\n\n-   `age = 0`: The lemur is 0 months old at the time of the weight\n-   `sexM = 0`: The lemur is female.\n-   `taxonPCOQ = 0` and `taxonVRUB = 0`: The lemur is from the ERUF taxon. (See @tbl-indicators to confirm this)\n-   `litter_size = 0`: There were 0 lemurs in the litter size in which the lemurs born. (Note that this is not a possible in the data set).\n\nBased on the model, the expected weight for such lemurs is about 43.844 grams.\n\nPutting this together in narrative form, we have\n\n> The expected weight for female lemurs from the ERUF taxon who are 0 months old at the time of weight and were born into a litter with 0 lemurs is about 43.844 grams.\n\nAs in SLR, we need the intercept to get the least-squares model. The intercept, however, does not always have a meaningful interpretation in practice. Therefore, as with simple linear regression, the intercept has a meaningful interpretation when the following are true:\n\n1.  The scenario described by [**all**]{.underline} the predictors in the model being at or near zero is plausible in practice.\n\n2.  The data used to fit the model includes observations in which [**all**]{.underline} the predictors are at or near zero.\n\n::: {.yourturn latex=\"\"}\nBased on these criteria, do you think the interpretation of the intercept is meaningful for the lemurs data? Why or why not?[^07-mlr-5]\n:::\n\n[^07-mlr-5]: It is not, because it is not possible for a lemur to be born into a litter of size 0. The litter size must be at least 1.\n\n## Prediction\n\nThe same process is used to predict for multiple linear regression as the one introduced in @sec-slr-predict for simple linear regression. Now that there are two or more predictor variables, we need to input a value for every predictor variable.\n\nFor example, suppose we wish to use the model in @tbl-lemurs-model to compute the predicted weight for a 10-month old male lemur in the VRUB taxon who was born into a litter of 4 lemurs. We compute this value by plugging in the value for the new observation into the model equation as shown in @eq-lemurs-predict.\\\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\widehat{\\text{weight\\_g}} &= 43.844 \\\\ &+ 136.903 \\times 10 \\\\ &- 88.838 \\times 1 \\\\ &+ 471.715 \\times 0 \\\\ &+ 1037.323 \\times 1 \\\\ &- 19.607 \\times 4 \\\\\n& = 2282.931\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-lemurs-predict}\n\n::: {.yourturn latex=\"\"}\nUse the equation in @tbl-lemurs-model to compute the predicted value for a 14-month old female lemur in the ERUF taxon who was born into a litter of 2 lemurs.

This can sometimes to be challenging to assess, as extrapolation might occur both in terms of a single predictor variable being far outside the range in the data but also in terms of a combination of predictors being outside the general patterns observed in the data. When working with real-world data, we can consider if the combination of predictor values can be realistically observed in the population being studied. If that is the case, and the data are representative of the population, then the combination of values if likely to be within the trend represented in the data.\n\nOne more consideration for prediction is that we expect there to be some uncertainty in the predicted values, because they are computed based on a model fit using sample data. <!--# We will discuss this uncertainty further in @sec-ch-mlr-inf.--> <!--# need to add something about prediction intervals-->\n\n## Centered and standardized predictors {#sec-other-predictors}\n\n<!--# insert some intro sentences-->\n\n### Centered quantitative predictors\n\n<!--# make a note here that it is called centering because we are changing the center of the data but not rescaling it-->\n\n<!--# do i make the point anywhere that centering doesn't not change the units of the variable-->\n\nWe need an intercept to fit the least-squares regression model, but it may not have a meaningful interpretation as seen in the example in @sec-intercept. This is usually because it is not meaningful or realistic for a quantitative variable to take values at or near zero. One way to remedy this is to shift the distribution of one or more quantitative predictors, such that it would be feasible for the shifted predictors to take values near zero. This process is called centering.\n\n<!--# is it always called centering if we're just shifting the variable? -->\n\n**Centering** a predictor means to shift every observation of that predictor by a single constant, denoted $C$. For example, given a predictor $X$, then the centered version of the predictor is $X_{cent} = X - C$. Thus when $X_{cent}$ is a predictor in the model (instead of $X$), then the intercept is now the expected response when $X_{cent} = X - C = 0$, which occurs when $X = C$.\n\nIn the previous section, we determined that it is not possible for the litter size to be 0, because the litter size includes the observed lemur. Therefore, we can use centering to create a new variable `litter_size_cent` by shifting `litter_size` by 1, so that `litter_size_cent = 0` means `litter_size = 1` . Though it is not always the case, the newly centered variable `litter_size_cent` has a new meaningful interpretation. It is the number of siblings of in the litter. Putting this together, `litter_size_cent` = 0 means the lemur was born into a litter with no siblings.\n\nBecause this centered variable has its own meaningful interpretation, we will rename the variable to more clearly indicate what this variable is measuring. We call the centered variable `litter_size_siblings` and use this name for the centered variable moving forward. The distributions of the original and centered variables are shown in @fig-centering and @tbl-centering.\n\n\n::: {#fig-centering .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of `litter_size`](07-mlr_files/figure-html/fig-centering-1.png){#fig-centering-1 width=100%}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of `litter_size_siblings`](07-mlr_files/figure-html/fig-centering-2.png){#fig-centering-2 width=100%}\n:::\n\nOriginal versus centered values of `litter_size`\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-centering .cell tbl-cap='Distributions of `litter_size` vs `litter_size_siblings`'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Variable             | Mean|  SD| Min| Q1| Median (Q2)| Q3| Max|\n|:--------------------|----:|---:|---:|--:|-----------:|--:|---:|\n|litter_size          |  1.7| 0.9|   1|  1|           1|  3|   4|\n|litter_size_siblings |  0.7| 0.9|   0|  0|           0|  2|   3|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom @fig-centering and @tbl-centering, we see that the only statistics that have changed are those about location (e.g., $Q1$, $Q3$, min, max) and those related the center (mean and median).

This shows that centering one or more quantitative predictors, by shifting by the mean or some other constant, does not change the relationships between the predictor variables with the response variable. With this in mind, let's interpret the intercept for the model with the centered variables.\n\nAs before, the intercept is the expected weight when all the predictors are equal to 0. Thus, using the model in @tbl-lemurs-model-centered, the intercept is the expected weight when\n\n-   `age_cent = 0`: The lemur is the mean age in the sample, 9.05 months old.\n\n-   `sexM = 0`: The lemur is female.\n\n-   `taxonPCOQ = 0` and `taxonVRUB = 0`: The lemur is from the ERUF taxon.\n\n-   `litter_size_siblings = 0`: The lemur was born into a litter with 0 other lemurs (`litter_size = 1`).\n\n<!--# OLD TEXT: Before we write the full interpretation, let's see why age_at_weight_mo and litter_size are at the mean values when we interpret the intercept. -->\n\n<!--# OLD TEXT: insert latex showing the quick equation-->\n\n<!--# OLD TEXT: The same holds true for litter_size. -->\n\nThe interpretation of the intercept in narrative form when the quantitative predictors are centered is\n\n> *The expected weight for female lemurs from the ERUF taxon who are 9.05 months old and were born into a litter with no siblings is about 1263.178 grams.*\n\nBecause the coefficients for the other predictors are the same, the interpretations for these predictors are the same as in @sec-mlr-interpret-quantitative and @sec-mlr-interpret-categorical.\n\n### Standardized quantitative predictors\n\nThus far, we have interpreted the coefficients to understand the relationship between the response and each predictor variable. Sometimes, however, the primary objective of the analysis may be less focused on interpretation and more focused on identifying which predictors are most important in understanding variability in the response variable. When that is the case, we can fit a model using standardized values of the quantitative predictors.\n\n<!--# Add something about why we can't compare across scales for original variables.-->\n\n**Standardizing** a variable is shifting every observation of that variable by its mean (as in mean-centering) and dividing by its standard deviation. Thus, given a quantitative predictor $X$, the standardized value of $X$, denoted $X_{std}$, is\n\n$$\nX_{std} = \\frac{X - \\bar{X}}{s_X}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{X}$ is the mean of $X$ and $s_{X}$ is the standard deviation of $X$. In addition to shifting the centered of the new distribution to be equal to 0, the standardized variable is rescaled such the standard deviation (and variance) of the standardized variable is 1. This is similar to computing a $z$- score from the normal distribution.\n\n<!--# Key term: Standardizing a variable is shifting it by its mean and dividing by its standard deviation-->\n\n```{=html}\n<!--# $$\nX_{std} = \\frac{X - \\bar{X}}{s_X}\n$$-->\n```\n\nUnlike centering, standardizing a variable changes its units, because it is rescaled by the standard deviation. Therefore, the units are no longer the original units but rather the number of standard deviations an observation is away from the mean value. Because the units have changed, the value (but not the sign!) of the coefficient for standardized variables will change as well. @tbl-lemurs-model-std shows the output of the model using standardized coefficients for `age` and `litter_size`. Similar to centering, we only standardize quantitative predictors, as there is no meaningful notion of \"average\" or \"standard deviation\" for categorical predictors such as `taxon` or `sex`.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-lemurs-model-std .cell tbl-cap='Model with standardized coefficients for quantitative predictors'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|term            | estimate| std.error| statistic| p.value|\n|:---------------|--------:|---------:|---------:|-------:|\n|(Intercept)     |   1249.0|      89.4|    13.978|   0.000|\n|age_at_wt_std   |    960.1|      34.1|    28.182|   0.000|\n|sexM            |    -88.8|      68.0|    -1.306|   0.193|\n|taxonPCOQ       |    471.7|      95.4|     4.943|   0.000|\n|taxonVRUB       |   1037.3|     133.9|     7.747|   0.000|\n|litter_size_std |    -18.1|      60.8|    -0.298|   0.766|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow let's compare the model with standardized quantitative predictors to the original model and the model using centered quantitative predictors. @tbl-lemurs-model-compare-pt2 shows the comparison of these models.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-lemurs-model-compare-pt2 .cell tbl-cap='Model coefficients for original model,  model with centered quantitiatve predictors, and model with standardized quantitative predictors'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Term        | Original| Centered| Standardized|\n|:-----------|--------:|--------:|------------:|\n|(Intercept) |     43.8|   1263.2|       1249.0|\n|age         |    136.9|    136.9|        960.1|\n|sexM        |    -88.8|    -88.8|        -88.8|\n|taxonPCOQ   |    471.7|    471.7|        471.7|\n|taxonVRUB   |   1037.3|   1037.3|       1037.3|\n|litter_size |    -19.6|    -19.6|        -18.1|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.yourturn latex=\"\"}\nThe coefficients for `sexM` , `taxonPCOQ`, and `taxonVRUB` are the same across all three models.

Because all the quantitative predictors are now on the same scale, we can look at the magnitude of the coefficients to rank the predictors in terms of importance. <!--# make sure this is true in terms of categorical predictors--> From the coefficients in @tbl-lemurs-model-std, we see that `taxonVRUB` is the most important predictor, because it has the coefficient with the highest magnitude, i.e., the highest absolute value. This means that just knowing the lemur is from the VRUB taxon results in the largest expected change in the weight, on average, even after adjusting for the other predictors.\n\n::: {.yourturn latex=\"\"}\nBased on @tbl-lemurs-model-std, which predictor is the least important for predicting the weight of lemurs?[^07-mlr-8]\n:::\n\n[^07-mlr-8]: The variable `litter_size` , because it has the coefficient with the smallest magnitude, \\|18.128 \\|= 18.128 .\n\n## Interaction terms {#sec-mlr-interaction}\n\n<!--# do i call these interaction effects or terms? -->\n\n<!--# I could move this section before transformations and higher-order terms. Could also move those sections to a different chapter?-->\n\nThus far, we have fit models in which the coefficient of each predictor is the same for all lemurs. What if, however, the effect of one predictor on the response variable differed by values of another predictor? For example, what if the relationship between age and weight differed based on the lemur's taxon? Or what if the relationship between litter size and weight differed by age? Or what if the relationship between sex and weight differed by taxon? We can explore all of these, and similar, questions by including interaction terms in the regression model.\n\nSometimes the relationship between one predictor and the response variable differs based on values of another predictor variable. We account for this difference by including **interaction terms** in the regression model. There are three types of interaction terms between two variables: interaction between a quantitative and categorical predictor, interaction between two categorical predictors, and interaction between two quantitative predictors. We discuss all three types of potential interaction terms here. Note, however, we most often include interaction terms involving a categorical predictor, because we want to account for the unique relationship between the response and predictor variable for different subgroups of the population.\n\n<!--# Key term: An interaction term quantifies how much the relationship between the response and one predictor differs based on values of another predictor.-->\n\n<!--# add something here that shows that interactions are one variable multiplied by another -->\n\n### Interaction between a quantitative and a categorical predictor\n\nDo different types of lemurs grow at different rates? We can explore this question by looking at the relationship between weight and age and how that differs (or not) by taxon. Before fitting the models, we can use exploratory data analysis to get an initial understanding about the relationship between age and weight for each taxon. In @sec-mlr-eda, we used univariate and bivariate exploratory data analysis to explore one variable and two variables, respectively. Now when we look at potential interaction effects, we use multivariate exploratory data analysis as introduced in @sec-ch-eda.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Multivariate EDA to explore potential interaction effect between `age` and `taxon`](07-mlr_files/figure-html/fig-lemurs-age-taxon-int-1.png){#fig-lemurs-age-taxon-int width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-lemurs-age-taxon-int shows the relationship between `age` and `weight` by `taxon`. Based on the lines, it appears that there is some difference in the relationship between age and weight depending on the taxon, as the slopes of the lines appear to differ. Thus, the plot suggests a potential interaction effect that is worth exploring in the model. If there was no potential interaction effect, then the lines would be parallel (i.e., the same slope). As with any exploratory data analysis, we do not use this plot to conclude whether or not there is an interaction effect; we will use the regression model and statistical inference for those purposes.

The interaction terms are indicated in the output in the format `var1:var2`; for example, the interaction term of `age` for the PCOQ taxon is labeled as `age:taxonPCOQ`. This individual term is an estimate of how much the slope of `age` differs between the taxa PCOQ and ERUF, the baseline. Thus, the interpretation is\n\n> *The slope of age for lemurs in the PCOQ taxon is about 96.085 greater for lemurs in PCOQ compared to lemurs in the ERUF taxon. This means for each additional month older a lemur is, the weight of a PCOQ lemur is expected to increase by 96.085 grams [**more**]{.underline}, on average, compared to an ERUF lemur, holding sex and litter size constant.*\n\nThis interpretation aligns with the steep slope of the line for the PCOQ species in @fig-lemurs-age-taxon-int. Note from the interpretation that coefficient of the interaction effect is how much the relationship between age and weight differ for the PCOQ species compared to the ERUF species, but it is [**not**]{.underline} the overall relationship between age and weight for PCOQ lemurs. To get that value, we must add the main effect of age (`age`) and the interaction effect (`age:taxonPCOQ`).\n\n> *The overall slope of age for PCOQ lemurs is 174.664 (78.579 + 96.085 ).

Interpret it in the context of the data.[^07-mlr-10]\n:::\n\n[^07-mlr-10]: The slope of age for lemurs in the VRUB taxon is 127.931 (78.579 + 49.352). This means that among VRUB lemurs, for each additional month in age, the weight is expected to be greater by 127.931 grams, on average, holding sex and litter size constant.\n\nBy now we have quantified the relationship between age and weight for PCOQ and VRUB lemurs, but what about this relationship for ERUF lemurs, the baseline category? The interaction effect `age:taxonPCOQ` is the adjustment in the slope of age for PCOQ lemurs; the same is true about `age:taxonVRUB` for VRUB lemurs. Therefore, neither of these interaction effects apply to ERUF lemurs. Putting all this together, the coefficient of `age` for ERUF lemurs is 78.579. The term in the model `age` is called a **main effect**, because it describes the relationship between the response and predictor variable (among the baseline subgroup). The terms `age:taxonPCOQ` and `age:taxonVRUB` called **interaction effects**, because they are how much the relationship between the response and one predictor differs by values of another predictor.\n\n<!--# Key terms: The main effect is the term in the model quantifying the relationship between the response and predictor.

Let's consider the interaction between `taxon` and `sex` for this data. We might include this interaction effect if we want to explore whether the relationship between sex and weight differs by taxon.[^07-mlr-11]\n\n[^07-mlr-11]: The interaction between sex and taxon would also tell us if the relationship between taxon and weight differs by sex. We have decided to interpret the interaction effect in the other direction given it is more practically meaningful to understand differences between sexes within each taxon versus the other way around.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![`weight` versus `sex` by `taxon`](07-mlr_files/figure-html/fig-lemurs-taxon-sex-int-1.png){#fig-lemurs-taxon-sex-int width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-lemurs-taxon-sex-int shows the relationship between `sex` and `weight` by `taxon`. Recall that an interaction effect means that the relationship between one predictor and the response variable differs by values of another predictor. Therefore, as we examine this plot, we are looking to see whether the relationship between sex and weight appears similar or different for each taxon (see @sec-multivar-eda). When we look at the boxplots for male and female relative to one another in the figure, we don't see much difference across the three taxa, as there is a lot of overlap between the box plots for each taxon. The median weight for males versus females appears to differ for PCOQ lemurs compared to the other two groups. Thus, from the EDA we might expect a useful interaction for sex and the PCOQ species, but maybe not for VRUB.\n\nWe add this interaction term in to the model using the same syntax as before.

For example, the interaction term for PCOQ lemurs, `sexM:taxonPCOQ` = -387.382. This interpretation of this value is as follows:\n\n> *The difference in the average weight of male lemurs compared to female lemurs is predicted to be 387.382 grams less for lemurs from the PCOQ taxon compared to those in the ERUF taxon, holding age and litter size constant.*\n\nAs before, to get the overall difference in the average weight between male and female lemurs for the PCOQ species, we add the coefficients for the main effect `sexM` and the interaction effect `sexM:taxonPCOQ`. The overall effect of sex for PCOQ lemurs is -218.144 (169.238 + -387.382). The interpretation of this value is as follows:\n\n> *For lemurs in the PCOQ taxon, the weight of male lemurs is expected to be 218.144 grams less than the weight of female lemurs, on average, holding age and litter size constant.*\n\n::: {.yourturn latex=\"\"}\n-   What is the overall effect of `sexM` for lemurs in the VRUB taxon?\n-   What is the overall effect of `sexM` for lemurs in the ERUF taxon?[^07-mlr-12]\n:::\n\n[^07-mlr-12]: The overall effect of `sexM` for lemurs in the VRUB taxon is -83.971 (169.238 + -253.209 ). The overall effect of `sexM` for lemurs in the ERUF taxon is 169.238\n\n### Interaction between two quantitative predictors\n\nThe last type of interaction is between two quantitative predictors. This type of interaction is less common than the interactions including at least one categorical predictor, but they can be found in some scientific contexts<!--# be more specific and find a reference / example here-->. For the lemurs analysis, we will look at the interaction effect between `age` and `litter_size`. As with the interaction effect between two categorical predictors, we can interpret the interaction between `age` and `litter_size` as how much the effect of litter size changes as age changes or how much the effect of age changes as litter size changes. While either of these interpretations would be statistically valid, we will focus on the how the effect of litter size changes as age changes. This will allow us to more directly explore whether the impact of a lemur's birth conditions (represented by the litter size) changes as the lemur gets older.\n\nVisualizations for the potential interaction effect between two quantitative predictors can be complex, because a continuous predictor can take on infinitely many values. Therefore, when visualizing the potential interaction effect, we will create bins for one of the predictors and use the bins to see how the value of one of the predictors changes based on the other. <!--# this sentence is very muddled--> @fig-lemurs-age-litter-int is a scatterplot exploring the potential interaction between age and litter size.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![`weight` versus `litter_size` by `age`](07-mlr_files/figure-html/fig-lemurs-age-litter-int-1.png){#fig-lemurs-age-litter-int width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBecause we are specifically interested in interpreting how the effect of litter size changes as age changes, we have created bins to mark off age ranges and looked a the scatterplot of litter size and weight for each bin.\n\nIn @fig-lemurs-age-litter-int, the relationship between litter size and weight appears flatter for the older age groups, in particular the 20 - 25 month age group. This means it appears that litter size has much more impact on the weight among very young lemurs compared to those closer to two years old. As with all exploratory data analysis, we can not make a definitive conclusion based on this visualization alone, so we will fit a model with this interaction using the code below.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-lemurs-age-litter-int-model .cell tbl-cap='Output for regression model including interaction between `age` and `litter_size`'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|term            | estimate| std.error| statistic| p.value|\n|:---------------|--------:|---------:|---------:|-------:|\n|(Intercept)     |   -132.3|    148.49|    -0.891|   0.374|\n|age             |    155.6|     10.34|    15.046|   0.000|\n|sexM            |    -69.6|     68.22|    -1.020|   0.309|\n|taxonPCOQ       |    477.7|     94.86|     5.036|   0.000|\n|taxonVRUB       |   1042.5|    133.07|     7.834|   0.000|\n|litter_size     |     77.4|     80.78|     0.958|   0.339|\n|age:litter_size |    -10.9|      5.33|    -2.045|   0.042|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nThe output for the model with the interaction between `age` and `litter_size` is in @tbl-lemurs-age-litter-int-model. The coefficient for the term `age:litter_size` is the amount the effect of litter size changes as age increases by 1 month. It is interpreted as follows:\n\n> For each additional month in age, the slope of litter size and weight decreases by 10.902, on average, holding taxon and sex constant.\n\nAs with previous interaction effects, we add the coefficients for the main effect term and interaction term to get the overall effect of litter size at different ages. Recall that interaction effects are just two predictor variables multiplied together, so we need to plug in a value of age to get the overall effect of litter for that age. When we had interaction effects with at least one categorical predictor, we plugged in the 1 or 0 for the indicator variable. Now we can choose any age in the range of our data to plug in. We may also want to plug in a few different ages throughout the range to see how the effect of litter size compares for different ages.\n\nLet's interpret the effect of litter size for lemurs who are 12 months old. The effect of litter size for lemurs of this age is -53.4 (77.424 + 12 $\\times$ -10.902). The interpretation is as follows:\n\n> *For lemurs who are 12 months old, for each additional lemur in their litter, their weight is expected to be less by 53.4 grams, on average, holding sex and taxon constant.*\n\nThe coefficient of the main effect of `litter_size` is the effect of litter size when `age = 0`. There are no lemurs who are 0 months old in the data, so we should be cautious about trying to derive meaning from the main effect of litter size in this model or refit the model using the centered values of the quantitative predictors.\n\n::: {.yourturn latex=\"\"}\nWhat is the overall effect of litter size for lemurs who are 20 months old? Interpret this value in the context of the data.[^07-mlr-13]\n:::\n\n[^07-mlr-13]: The overall effect of litter size for lemurs who are 20 months old is 66.522 .

Though such interactions are possible, they should be used with caution to avoid fitting the model too closely to the sample data and losing generalizability (called model overfit). These complex interactions also become difficult to interpret and can be harder to explain to a general audience.\n\nTherefore, we recommend only using interaction effects with two variables unless there is a specific research or analysis objective that benefits from the more complex interaction effects.\n:::\n\n<!--# need to have quadratic predictors here-->\n\n<!--# do we call adding the quadratic term to the model a transformation?-->\n\n<!--# do we need to explain why we add the linear term when adding quadratic effect but not a linear term in addition to log transformaton-->\n\n<!--# do i leave this here or have another chapter or section for transformations?

The variable names in the tibble of new observations must match the column names in the original data exactly, including letter case. Additionally, the observed values of the categorical predictors are put in the tibble, not indicator variables. As with variable names, the values of the categorical predictors must be input exactly as they show in the data set (including case).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnew_lemur <- tibble(age = 10, \n                    taxon = \"VRUB\", \n                    sex = \"M\", \n                    litter_size = 4)\n  \n  \npredict(lemurs_model, new_lemur)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   1 \n2283 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can also use `predict()` to compute the predicted values for multiple new observations.

We introduced a various different predictors that can be in the model, including categorical predictors and interaction terms. We showed how to use R to estimate model coefficients and compute predictions from the model. We expect there is uncertainty in the coefficient estimates produced by the regression model, given it was fit using sample data. In the next chapter, we will discuss inference for multiple linear regression and use it to draw conclusions about the relationships between the response and predictor variables.\n\n<!--# Exercise-->\n\n<!--# Come back to Lemur data from conditions chapter-->\n\n<!--# example where the centering is to shift the data by some year-->\n\n<!--# Should include centering by a year or make this an exercise?-->\n\n<!--# Use the lemurs data set for exercises-->\n\n<!--# how do coefficients for categorical predictors compare across original , mean-centered, and standardized models? why they the same across all three models? -->\n\n\n\n\n\n<!--# exercise to about indicator variables and plugging in 1/0 in interaction effects-->\n",
