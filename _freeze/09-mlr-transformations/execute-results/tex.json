The data come from the Equity in Athletics Data Analysis (EADA) tool from the Office of Postsecondary Education in the United States Department of Education ([ope.ed.gov/athletics](https://ope.ed.gov/athletics/#/)). Every college and university in the United States that offers both student financial aid and intercollegiate programs (this includes nearly all colleges and universities) are required by law to submit information about its spending and revenue on athletic programs annually [@ope_equity_athletics_database].\n\nThe EADA is a very rich data set with over 300 hundred variables about basketball and all other collegiate sports for all 2-year and 4-year institutions that meet the federal reporting requirements.[^09-mlr-transformations-1] This analysis will focus on data from schools in the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) Division I. According to the NCAA, Division I institutions are those that \"have to sponsor at least seven sports for men and seven for women (or six for men and eight for women) with two team sports for each gender. Each playing season has to be represented by each gender as well. There are contest and participant minimums for each sport, as well as scheduling criteria\" [@ncaa_divisional_differences_2013]. We will refer to these institutions as \"NCAA Division I colleges\" or just \"colleges\" throughout the remainder of the chapter.\n\n[^09-mlr-transformations-1]: Interested readers are encouraged to visit the EADA for further data exploration!\n\nThe data in `ncaa-basketball-DI-2023-2024.csv` contains data from the 2023 - 2024 academic year. We will use the following variables that have been derived from variables in the EADA.\n\n-   `expenditure_m`: Total expenditure on basketball programs (in millions of US dollars)\n-   `enrollment_th`: Total student enrollment (in thousands)\n-   `type`: Whether the college is public or private\n-   `region`: Region where the college is located. The regions are defined using the `state.region` vector in R.\n\n::: {.objective latex=\"\"}\nThe goal of this analysis is to use the student enrollment, region, and type of college to explain variability in the total expenditure on basketball programs in the 2023 - 2024 academic year.\n:::\n\n### Exploratory data analysis {#sec-ncaa-eda}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of the response variable `expenditure_m`](09-mlr-transformations_files/figure-pdf/fig-ncaa-response-eda-1.png){#fig-ncaa-response-eda width=85%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-ncaa-pred-eda .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![`enrollment_th`](09-mlr-transformations_files/figure-pdf/fig-ncaa-pred-eda-1.png){#fig-ncaa-pred-eda-1 width=85%}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![`region`](09-mlr-transformations_files/figure-pdf/fig-ncaa-pred-eda-2.png){#fig-ncaa-pred-eda-2 width=85%}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![`type`](09-mlr-transformations_files/figure-pdf/fig-ncaa-pred-eda-3.png){#fig-ncaa-pred-eda-3 width=85%}\n:::\n\nDistributions of predictor variables\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-ncaa-univariate-summary .cell tbl-cap='Summary statistics for `enrollment_th` and `expenditure_m`'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Variable      | Mean|  SD| Min|  Q1| Median (Q2)|   Q3|  Max| Missing|\n|:-------------|----:|---:|---:|---:|-----------:|----:|----:|-------:|\n|expenditure_m |  8.3| 7.0| 1.3| 3.7|         5.0| 10.8| 38.1|       0|\n|enrollment_th | 11.9| 9.9| 1.0| 4.6|         7.9| 17.8| 59.6|       0|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe response variable `expenditure_m` in @fig-ncaa-response-eda is unimodal and skewed right. The median expenditure on basketball programs is 5 million dollars, but there are a few colleges that spent over 30 million dollars on basketball programs in 2023 - 2024. Similarly, `enrollment_th` in @fig-ncaa-pred-eda-1 is unimodal and skewed right, with a median enrollment of about 7900 students. There are some very large colleges in the data set with enrollments of over 40,000 students.\n\nAlmost half of the 355 colleges in the data are located in the South region (@fig-ncaa-pred-eda-2), and about two-thirds of the colleges in the data set are public institutions (@fig-ncaa-pred-eda-3).\n\n\n::: {#fig-ncaa-bivariate-eda .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![`expenditure_m` versus `enrollment_th`](09-mlr-transformations_files/figure-pdf/fig-ncaa-bivariate-eda-1.png){#fig-ncaa-bivariate-eda-1 width=85%}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![`expenditure_m` versus `region`](09-mlr-transformations_files/figure-pdf/fig-ncaa-bivariate-eda-2.png){#fig-ncaa-bivariate-eda-2 width=85%}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![`expenditure_m` versus `type`](09-mlr-transformations_files/figure-pdf/fig-ncaa-bivariate-eda-3.png){#fig-ncaa-bivariate-eda-3 width=85%}\n:::\n\nBivariate exploratory data analysis\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nFrom the bivariate exploratory data analysis in @fig-ncaa-bivariate-eda-1, there appears to be a strong positive relationship between the enrollment and expenditure. This aligns with what we might expect; colleges with more students are likely to spend more on basketball programs. We note that this trend does seem to level off for colleges with very high enrollment, because their expenditure is lower than what we would expect if expenditure increased as a constant rate for values of enrollment (called *monotonically increasing*).\n\nThe plot also shows two other interesting features of the relationship. The first is that the variability in the expenditure increases as enrollment increases. Thus, there is more variability in how much colleges with larger enrollments spend on basketball programs compared to colleges with small enrollments. We will keep this issue of the changing variability in mind as we fit a model and evaluate the model conditions. The second observation is the appearance of a \"V\" shape in the trend, indicating two different trajectories. This could be an indication of a potential interaction, so let's look at multivariate plots to explore a potential interaction between enrollment and type and one between enrollment and region.\n\n\n::: {#fig-ncaa-eda-multivariate .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![`expenditure_m` versus `enrollment_th` by `type`](09-mlr-transformations_files/figure-pdf/fig-ncaa-eda-multivariate-1.png){#fig-ncaa-eda-multivariate-1 width=85%}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![`expenditure_m` versus `enrollment_th` by `region`](09-mlr-transformations_files/figure-pdf/fig-ncaa-eda-multivariate-2.png){#fig-ncaa-eda-multivariate-2 width=85%}\n:::\n\nExploration of potential interaction terms\n:::\n\n\n::: {.yourturn latex=\"\"}\nBased on the plots in @fig-ncaa-eda-multivariate, do there appear to be any potential interaction effects?

Because the equal variance condition is not met, the results of theory-based inference output in @tbl-ncaa-model-orig cannot reliably be used to draw conclusions about the relationships between the response and predictor variables. For example, the inferential results suggest the interaction between enrollment and institution type is not useful in this model, despite what we observed in @fig-ncaa-eda-multivariate. Before making a final conclusion about the interaction term ad any other term in the model, let's first address the issue with the equal variance condition.\n\nHere is a summary of some of the points of interest we've observed thus far in the exploratory data analysis and initial modeling attempt.\n\n1.  The relationship between `enrollment_th` and `expenditure_m` seems to \"level off\" for high-enrollment colleges, thus the relationship may be non-linear.\n\n2.  There is a fan shape in the plot of the residuals versus predicted values, indicating a violation of the equal variance condition.\n\n3.  The exploratory data analysis suggests there is a potential interaction between `enrollment_th` and `type`.\n\nNote that items (1) and (2) are about the model fit and item (3) is about a conclusion drawn from the model. Thus we need to address items (1) and (2) before digging further into item (3). To do so, we will examine three additional models that differ based on transformations on the response variable `expenditure_m` and/or `enrollment_th`, the quantitative predictor variable. Transformations only apply to quantitative variables, so `type` and `region` will remain unchanged in the subsequent models throughout the chapter.\n\nThroughout the chapter, we will interpret the coefficients and evaluate the model conditions for each of the new candidate models. We'll then use model performance statistics along with the conditions to select the model that best fits the data. The candidate models are the following:\n\nA.  Original model with no transformations (shown in @tbl-ncaa-model-orig)\nB.  Log-transformation on the response variable, $\\log(y)$\nC.  Log-transformation on the quantitative predictor variable, $\\log(x)$\nD.

In this chapter, we will look at the transformations presented in Plots B - D in the order they are plotted. In practice, however, you can use insights from the exploratory data analysis to start with the model that appears to be the best fit for the data. We do not draw definitive conclusions from the exploratory data analysis, so we will use inference, model conditions, and model fit statistics to select the best fit model. For now, we will just discuss these transformations in terms of a main effects model. In @sec-transform-choose-model, we add the interaction term to our selected model.\n\n## Transformation on the response variable {#sec-transform-logy}\n\n<!--# need to make it clear somewhere that this is the natural log, not something like log10-->\n\nThe plot of residuals versus predicted variables in @fig-ncaa-orig-resid shows a clear violation in the equal variance condition based on the fan-shaped pattern of the residuals when moving from left to right. Recall from @sec-conditions-not-satisfied that it is necessary to satisfy the equal variance condition when doing theory-based inference (the inference results produced by output), because it relies on a single estimate of $\\hat{\\sigma}_{\\epsilon}$, the regression standard error (variability about the regression line). We can easily see in @fig-ncaa-orig-resid that a single value would not be representative of the vertical spread of the residuals for all predicted values. Thus, the inferential results in @tbl-ncaa-model-orig should be interpreted with caution.\n\nOne solution to this is to use the simulation-based inference methods introduced in @sec-mlr-sim-inf, because the sampling distribution and null distribution for an estimated coefficient $\\hat{\\beta}_j$ are constructed relying only on the data, rather than any underlying assumptions about the distribution of $\\hat{\\beta}_j$. Another approach is to use a transformation on the response variable to reduce the impacts of the different vertical spreads in the response variable. Such transformations are called **variance-stabilizing transformations**.\n\n<!--# do i need a callout terminology box highlighting the definition of variance-stabilizing transformaiton?-->\n\n<!--# i really need to figure out syntax..upper or lower case y and x-->\n\nSome commonly used variance-stabilizing transformations are the square-root transformation, $\\sqrt{y}$ , and the reciprocal transformation, $1/y$ . In fact, the square root and reciprocal transformations are just two examples from the class of transformations called the **Box-Cox transformations** [@box1964analysis]. These transformations are designed to handle a non-normal response variable of any shape. While Box-Cox transformations, such as $\\sqrt{y}$ and $1/y$, can be the optional choice for stabilizing variance and making the distribution of the response variable more normal (recall the normality condition), it is often difficult to interpret the coefficients for models with such transformed response variables in a way that an be easily understood by readers. Therefore, we will not focus on Box-Cox transformations in this text, because one of our primary objectives is to produce models that are easily interpretable.\n\n<!--# read more about these and make sure this all aligns-->\n\n<!--# add callout box for Box-Cox transformations. History, what they are, and resources to learn more-->\n\nLet's consider another transformation for the response variable that can help address the violations in the equal variance condition while also being easily interpreted by the reader. We can apply a natural log transformation on the response variable, $\\log(y)$ (also written as $\\ln(y)$), such that $\\log(y)$ has the linear relationship with the predictor variables. @eq-log-y shows the statistical model when applying such transformation to the response variable.\n\n$$\n\\log(y_i) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_{i1} + \\beta_2x_{i2}+ \\dots + \\beta_px_{ip} + \\epsilon_i \\hspace{8mm} \\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_{\\epsilon})\n$$ {#eq-log-y}\n\n::: {.math_rules latex=\"\"}\n**log = ln**\n\nIn statistics, the term \"log\" refers to the natural log (typically denoted $\\ln$ in mathematics).\n:::\n\nAs shown in @eq-log-y, the log transformation is applied to the individual values of $Y$, and the transformed values are used in the model. Therefore, when we use a log (or any) transformation on the response variable, we assume the assumptions from @sec-slr-foundation apply to the relationship between the predictors and the transformed values of $Y$. Using @eq-log-y, this means we make assumptions about the relationship between the predictors and $\\log(y_i)$. The full analysis, including evaluating conditions and diagnostics, conducting inference, and computing predictions are done in terms of $\\log(y)$. Interpretations, however, are in terms of the original variable $y$. Although we can write interpretations in terms of $\\log(y)$ (we'll see an example of this shortly), it is not as intuitive for readers to understand interpretations on a log-scale as on the natural scale.\n\nLet's begin by looking at the distribution of `log(expenditure_m)`, its relationship with `enrollment_th`, and how these compare to the exploratory data analysis in @sec-transform-eda.\n\n\n::: {#fig-expend-compare .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of `expenditure_m`](09-mlr-transformations_files/figure-pdf/fig-expend-compare-1.png){#fig-expend-compare-1 width=85%}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of log-transformed `expenditure_m`](09-mlr-transformations_files/figure-pdf/fig-expend-compare-2.png){#fig-expend-compare-2 width=85%}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![`expenditure_m` versus `enrollmenth_th`](09-mlr-transformations_files/figure-pdf/fig-expend-compare-3.png){#fig-expend-compare-3 width=85%}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Log-transformed `expenditure_m` versus `enrollment_th`](09-mlr-transformations_files/figure-pdf/fig-expend-compare-4.png){#fig-expend-compare-4 width=85%}\n:::\n\nUnivariate and bivariate EDA for original and log-transformed `expenditure_m`\n:::\n\n\nNow we fit the main effects model using `log(expenditure_m)`, the log-transformed expenditure, as the response variable.

For now, let's interpret the coefficients for the model in @tbl-ncaa-model-logy. The approach for interpreting the model coefficients in terms of the log-transformed response variable is the same as the one introduced in @sec-transform-logy for other multiple linear regression models.

We could center `enrollment_th` , so that the intercept represents colleges with some other value of enrollment (e.g., the mean enrollment in the data).\n\n## Transformation on predictor variable(s) {#sec-transform-logx}\n\nTransformations on the response variable are often done to address violations in the equal variance condition, as shown in the previous section. In this section, we introduce transformations on one or more quantitative predictor variables that are used to model non-linear relationships with the response variable.\n\nIn the exploratory data analysis in @sec-ncaa-eda, we observed that the relationship between `expenditure_m` and `enrollment_th` flattened as `enrollment_th` increased. For Colleges with larger enrollments generally have a smaller increase in expenditures on basketball programs for each additional 1000 students compared to the increase in expenditures for colleges with smaller enrollments. We account for this decreasing effect by applying a log transformation on the predictor variable. Here we will transform a single predictor but we can apply a log transformation to multiple quantitative predictors in a model.\n\nThe general form of the linear regression model with a log-transformed predictor variable $x_j$ is shown in @eq-mlr-logx .\n\n$$\ny_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_{i1} + \\dots + \\beta_j\\log(x_{ij}) + \\dots + \\beta_px_{ip} + \\epsilon_i  \\hspace{5mm} \\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_{\\epsilon})\n$$ {#eq-mlr-logx}\n\n@eq-ncaa-logx shows the form of the model for NCAA Division I basketball expenditure using log-transformed values of enrollment.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{expenditure\\_m}_i = \\beta_0 &+ \\beta_1 \\log(\\text{enrollment\\_th}_i) + \\beta_2\\text{Northeast}_i + \\beta_3\\text{South}_i \\\\\n&+ \\beta_4\\text{West}_i + \\beta_5\\text{Public}_i + \\epsilon_i \\hspace{5mm} \\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_{\\epsilon})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-ncaa-logx}\n\nAt this point, we are using the original response variable, `expenditure_m`, so we can focus on understanding the log-transformed predictor variable. In the next section, we will look at the scenario in which both the response variable and one or more predictor variables is transformed. The output of the model with log-transformed enrollment is in @tbl-ncaa-model-logx.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-ncaa-model-logx .cell tbl-cap='Output of model with log-transformed `enrollment_th`'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|term               | estimate| std.error| statistic| p.value|\n|:------------------|--------:|---------:|---------:|-------:|\n|(Intercept)        |    1.297|     1.026|     1.265|   0.207|\n|log(enrollment_th) |    5.992|     0.400|    14.994|   0.000|\n|regionNortheast    |   -3.242|     0.991|    -3.271|   0.001|\n|regionSouth        |   -0.662|     0.793|    -0.835|   0.404|\n|regionWest         |   -2.919|     0.978|    -2.985|   0.003|\n|typePublic         |   -6.531|     0.783|    -8.337|   0.000|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's start by interpreting the intercept for this model. Because we have used the log-transformed value of enrollment in the model, the intercept represents the subgroup of NCAA Division 1 colleges such that `log(enrollment_th)` and all the other predictors are equal to 0. Based on the rules of logarithms, `log(enrollment_th)` is equal to 0 when `enrollment_th` is equal to 1, corresponding to an institution with 1000 students enrolled. The interpretation of the intercept for this model is the following:\n\n> *The expenditure on basketball programs for private NCAA Division 1 colleges in the North Central region with 1000 students enrolled (`log(enrollment_th) = 0`) is expected to be 1.297 million dollars.*\n\nNow let's look at the interpretation of the predictor variable `enrollment_th`. Using the coefficient interpretations introduced in @sec-mlr-interpret-quantitative, the interpretation is the following:\n\n> *When the log-transformed enrollment increases by 1, the expenditure on basketball programs at NCAA Division 1 colleges is expected to increase by 5.992 million dollars, holding type and region constant.*\n\nThough this interpretation is technically accurate, it is difficult to comprehend what an increase in the log-transformed enrollment actually means. Therefore, rather than interpreting the coefficient in terms of the log-transformed enrollment, we interpret enrollment in terms of its original units of 1000 students.\n\nBecause \\`enrollment_th\\` is on the logarithmic scale in the model, it is most straightforward <!--# diff word here--> to interpret the change in expenditure when enrollment is multiplied by a constant $C$. In general terms, given a model of the form in @eq-mlr-logx, the interpretation of predictor $X_j$ is below. The mathematical details for this interpretation are in @sec-transform-x-math. <!--# Maybe add more explanation about why you multiply a log-transformed variable rather than just increase by 1.

When choosing $C$, however, we need to be mindful about potential extrapolation and writing interpretations for values far outside the range of the data. Use values of $C$ between 1 and 2 to reduce potential extrapolation. Values in this range provide straightforward interpretations about the expected change when there is some percentage increase in the predictor (for example, $C = 1.1$ equals a 10% increase in the value of the predictor). Note, however, that there is a risk of extrapolating for observations with values at or near the maximum value of the predictor. For example, there is a college in the data with enrollment around 59,000. We should be cautious when using the model to interpret the expected change when enrollment doubles for this institution. This would equal an enrollment of over 118,000 students, which is far outside the range of the data. We cannot safely assume the relationship between `enrollment_th` and `expenditure_m` observed in @tbl-ncaa-model-logx is the same for colleges with such high enrollment (or that such colleges even exist!).\n\n::: {.yourturn latex=\"\"}\nWrite the interpretation of the expected change in expenditure on basketball programs when enrollment increases by 50% $(C = 1.5)$.[^09-mlr-transformations-6]\n:::\n\n[^09-mlr-transformations-6]: When the enrollment increases by 50% (is multiplied by 1.5), the expenditure on basketball programs at NCAA Division I colleges is expected to increase by 2.43 (5.992 $\\times$ log(1.5)) million dollars, on average, holding type and region constant.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Residuals vs. fitted values for plot with log-transformed `enrollment_th`](09-mlr-transformations_files/figure-pdf/fig-ncaa-logx-resid-1.png){#fig-ncaa-logx-resid width=85%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe plot of the residuals versus fitted values for the model @tbl-ncaa-model-logx is shown in @fig-ncaa-logx-resid.

Note when displaying results using `tidy()` the coefficients are contained in the column `estimate` .\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntidy(ncaa_model_final) |> \n  mutate(exp_coefficient = exp(estimate))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 7 x 6\n  term               estimate std.error statistic  p.value exp_coefficient\n  <chr>                 <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>           <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)           1.31     0.131       9.96 9.73e-21           3.70 \n2 log(enrollment_th)    0.524    0.0691      7.58 3.17e-13           1.69 \n3 regionNortheast      -0.339    0.0924     -3.67 2.78e- 4           0.712\n4 regionSouth          -0.117    0.0739     -1.58 1.14e- 1           0.890\n5 regionWest           -0.232    0.0912     -2.54 1.14e- 2           0.793\n6 typePublic           -1.28     0.162      -7.94 2.83e-14           0.277\n# i 1 more row\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nInstead of adding a new column, we may wish to automatically produce the exponentiated coefficients. The output produced by `tidy()` is in terms of the response variable by default. Therefore, the output is in terms of $\\log(y)$ when fitting a model with a log-transformed response variable. The argument `exponentiate = TRUE` in `tidy()` is used to output the exponentiated coefficients, $e^{\\beta_j}$, so the model output is in terms of the original variable.\n\nBelow is the code and output for the model in @tbl-ncaa-model-logx-logy-int in terms of the original response `expenditure_m`.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-ncaa-final-exponentiated .cell tbl-cap='Exponentiated coefficients for model using log-transformed repsonse and predictor'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nncaa_model_final <- lm(log(expenditure_m) ~ log(enrollment_th) + region + type + \n                         log(enrollment_th) * type, \n                       data = ncaa_basketball)\n\ntidy(ncaa_model_final, exponentiate = TRUE) |> \n  kable(digits = 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|term                          | estimate| std.error| statistic| p.value|\n|:-----------------------------|--------:|---------:|---------:|-------:|\n|(Intercept)                   |    3.698|     0.131|      9.96|   0.000|\n|log(enrollment_th)            |    1.689|     0.069|      7.58|   0.000|\n|regionNortheast               |    0.712|     0.092|     -3.67|   0.000|\n|regionSouth                   |    0.890|     0.074|     -1.58|   0.114|\n|regionWest                    |    0.793|     0.091|     -2.54|   0.011|\n|typePublic                    |    0.277|     0.162|     -7.94|   0.000|\n|log(enrollment_th):typePublic |    1.290|     0.081|      3.15|   0.002|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we introduced transformations for non-linear relationships, with a focus on log transformations. We used exploratory data analysis, plots of residuals versus fitted values, and subject matter knowledge to identify scenarios in which a transformation is needed to best capture the relationships in the data. We introduced variance-stabilizing transformations on the response variable to address violations of the equal variance condition and a log transformation on the predictor variable to capture decreasing effect as the predictor increases. We also presented and interpreted models with log transformations on both the response and predictor variables.\n\nWe used $R^2$ to select the model that best fit the data; however, there are other model performance statistics available to compare and select a model. In @sec-ch-model-eval, we will discuss model evaluation and selection in more depth, including stepwise methods and cross validation.\n",
